The producers agreed that the only person who should perform the character of Frank would have to be the original actor, Tim Curry. Curry, convinced by O\u2019Brien and Quinn, who was reprising her original character of Magenta, began his first film production along with American actress Susan Surandon and American Broadway actor Barry Bostwick playing the rolls of Janet Weiss and Brad Majors. The American rock star, Meatloaf, would also rejoin the Rocky Horror world, playing the roll of Eddie, the Ex-Delivery boy, which he played on the Roxy Cast. (Piro, 1990, VII)</p> <p>With the production of the movie complete, Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation released the film to a few key cities in late September, 1975. With the exception of Los Angeles, the movie was considered a failure to the general public, and was subsequently shelved with no thought given to a mass release. Collecting Dust, the movie reels sat until April 1st, 1976, when a young Fox executive, Tim Deegan, convinced the Waverly Theater in New York City to play it as the Midnight Feature. With this fortuitous event, The Rocky Horror Picture Show was on its way to infamy, stardom, and immortality. (Piro, 1990, VII)</p> <p>The Audience of the Waverly was already into the whole midnight movie phenomenon, booing villains and generally ignoring the common rules of etiquette that apply to standard movie goers. The theater played the record soundtrack of the movie before every showing, and the group of late night movie goers began to form together. This was the birthplace of Audience Participation, birthed from the creativity and sleep deprived minds of the Waverly Regulars. The pioneers of the audience participation were Louis Farese, credited with the first call back lines, a verbal line yelled at the screen from the audience, included \u201cBuy an umbrella, you cheap bitch!\u201d for when Janet walked through the rain up to the castle, and \u201cHow Strange was it?\u201d directed at Chucky during his original opening speech. Farese was impressed to yell his first line on Labor Day weekend, 1976. Farese was not alone in the creation of the cult, Bill O\u2019Brien was the first to dress up in costume, dressing up as Doctor Frank n\u2019 Furter. The character play came to a culmination on Halloween of 1976, when a number of the audience members showed up in costume, and O\u2019Brien and a few other regulars of the Waverly began to lip sink to the soundtrack recordings. \u201cThis was spontaneous and it developed into a mini-floor show before the movie. Audience response was tremendous.\u201d (Piro, 1990)</p>",visibility:"public",member_pay_fee:!1},{local_time:"19:00",local_date:"2019-11-20",link:"https://www.meetup.com/Denver-30s-40s-Professionals/events/265578781/",visibility:"public_limited",group:{created:151754402e4,name:"Denver 30s/40s Professionals",id:27352376,join_mode:"approval",lat:39.77000045776367,lon:-105.01000213623047,urlname:"Denver-30s-40s-Professionals",who:"Professionals",localized_location:"Denver, CO",state:"CO",country:"us",region:"en_US",timezone:"US/Mountain"},waitlist_count:0,yes_rsvp_count:8,duration:108e5,time:15743016e5,utc_offset:-252e5,name:"---\x3e>>>-----Skating into Winter----\x3e>>>----",id:"265578781"},{created:1563478026e3,duration:72e5,id:"263267074",name:"Don Quixote Colorado Ballet",rsvp_limit:20,date_in_series_pattern:!1,status:"upcoming",time:15709968e5,local_date:"2019-10-13",local_time:"14:00",rsvp_close_offset:"PT672H",updated:1568225999e3,utc_offset:-216e5,waitlist_count:0,yes_rsvp_count:17,venue:{id:26024978,name:"Ellie Caulkins Opera House at Denver Performing Arts Complex",lat:39.744964599609375,lon:-104.99736022949219,repinned:!0,address_1:"1385 Curtis Street",city:"Denver",country:"us",localized_country_name:"USA",zip:"80204",state:"CO"},group:{created:1434561971e3,name:"Classical Connection",id:18679951,join_mode:"open",lat:39.70000076293945,lon:-105.08000183105469,urlname:"Classical-Connection",who:"Cool Classics",localized_location:"Denver, CO",state:"CO",country:"us",region:"en_US",timezone:"US/Mountain"},link:"https://www.meetup.com/Classical-Connection/events/263267074/",description:"<p>Price for our regular seats is $40.00 and you must pay with in one week of your rspv.

Front end developers are finding it especially easy to dive into full-stack development with Nest, while backend developers from other frameworks are finding familiar features they expect from a top-class web framework.
